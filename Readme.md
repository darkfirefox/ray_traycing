# Ray-tracing by CUDA

## Overview

Create ray tracing with CUDA. Scene is generated by cuRand. Implemented:

* common geometry: sphere and plane

* materials: dielectric, metal, lambertian

* physical properties: schlick, refract, reflect

## How to use

* To generate ppm file:

* Convert ppm file to jpg:
